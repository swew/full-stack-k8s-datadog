![Kubernetes Monitoring with Datadog](https://datadog-prod.imgix.net/img/blog/monitor-google-kubernetes-engine/monitor-google-kubernetes-engine-hero.jpg)

Getting full visibility into a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster means gathering data about your nodes, pods, applications, and the state of the cluster itself. [Chick-fil-A](https://www.chick-fil-a.com/) is doing just that and will be showcasing how they use Kubernetes in their restaurants. 

The [Datadog](https://datadoghq.com/) community in Atlanta includes many skilled practitioners with deep knowledge and unique experiences to share, as well as a number of [Datadog](https://datadoghq.com/) staff. Presented November 13, we held a special event bringing together the local [Datadog](https://datadoghq.com/) community in an evening of conversation, drinks, and tech talks. Enabling people to meet their peers from local companies, share ideas and best practices, and learn actionable monitoring tips from our featured speakers!
